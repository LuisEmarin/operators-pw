   <h3>About me</h3> 
    <p> Hello! My name is Luis, I am a dedicated, motivated and, open-minded aspiring software developer.
    I am a father to three beautiful children, Kimberly, Omar, and Ian. These kids are my entire world, especially when they are not bickering (sibling stuff).
    I have a German Shepherd named Shadow, which I guess I should really be saying I have four children, since he tags along with us any time 
    he can, including trips. I love to explore new places, which my love for driving has allowed me to do, you can tell I don't hate it since I drove to Naples, Florida.
    </p>
    <h3>Hobbies</h3>
    <p>On my free time when I'm usually not breaking fights up ufc fights between siblings, I usually like to do outdoor activities. Some of the things I like to do are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Kayaking</li>
        <li>Hiking with Shadow</li>
        <li>Snowboarding</li>
        <li>Watching a good movie</li>
    </ul>
    <p></p>
